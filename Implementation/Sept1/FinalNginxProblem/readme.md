It sounds like your setup is a bit complex, with NGINX, Flask (app.py), and a security server (Securityserver.py) involved, and you also have a React frontend. The issue you're describing might be caused by the way requests are being routed between these components.
Understanding the Flow:

    React Frontend: Sends API requests to the Flask backend (app.py).
    Flask Backend: Handles business logic and interacts with the Securityserver.py for security-related tasks like encryption, token validation, etc.
    Security Server (Securityserver.py): Performs security operations, likely running on a different port or as a service.
    NGINX: Acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests to the appropriate backend services.

Potential Issues:

    Nginx Confusion: If NGINX is listening to the Securityserver.py but not handling the rate limiting for the app.py backend properly, it might be due to how NGINX is routing requests between the security server and the Flask backend.
    Double Proxying: Requests might be going through multiple layers (e.g., React -> NGINX -> Flask -> Security Server -> Flask), and NGINX might not be properly applying rate limits in this scenario.
    Security Server Bypass: If the security server is not fully integrated with NGINX, requests might bypass the intended security checks or rate limits.

Solutions:
1. Unified NGINX Configuration:

    Single Entry Point: Configure NGINX to act as the single entry point for all requests. Ensure that it properly routes requests to the app.py and Securityserver.py based on the API endpoint.
    Example Configuration:

    nginx

    worker_processes  1;

    events {
        worker_connections  1024;
    }

    http {
        # Define rate limiting
        limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=mylimit:10m rate=1r/s;

        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name localhost;

            # Apply rate limiting to all /api/ routes
            location /api/ {
                limit_req zone=mylimit burst=1 nodelay;

                # Route to Flask backend
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            }

            # Serve React frontend
            location / {
                root /path/to/your/react/build;
                try_files $uri /index.html;
            }

            # Proxy to the security server for security checks
            location /security/ {
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9000;  # Assuming security server is running on port 9000
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            }

            # Additional server settings (e.g., static files, logging, etc.)
            access_log  logs/access.log;
            error_log   logs/error.log;
        }
    }

    Explanation:
        Rate Limiting: Applied specifically to the /api/ routes to control the flow of requests to the Flask backend.
        Security Server Integration: Requests related to security can be routed through /security/ to the Securityserver.py.
        React Frontend: Static files are served directly by NGINX.

2. Simplifying the Architecture:

    If possible, consolidate the security checks and backend logic into a single Flask application to reduce the complexity of routing and rate limiting. This way, NGINX would only need to manage requests to a single backend service, making it easier to apply rate limits and other controls.

3. Use NGINX Subrequests:

    If the security checks need to be separate, you could use NGINX subrequests to ensure that rate limiting and security checks are applied in a specific order.
    Example:

    nginx

    location /api/ {
        limit_req zone=mylimit burst=1 nodelay;
        error_page 418 = @security_check;
        return 418;
    }

    location @security_check {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9000;  # Security Server
        proxy_set_header X-Original-URI $request_uri;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_pass_request_body off;
    }

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;  # Flask backend
        proxy_set_header X-Original-URI $request_uri;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }

4. Logging and Debugging:

    Check Logs: Make sure to thoroughly check NGINX logs to understand why it's not behaving as expected.
    Test with Simplified Configuration: Start with a simple configuration and gradually add complexity to pinpoint where the issue arises.
