1. Broken Object Level Authorization

Attack Description:
Attackers manipulate API requests to access or modify objects they shouldn't be authorized to. This often involves changing parameters such as user IDs or resource IDs in API requests.
Tools for Exploitation:

    Burp Suite:
        Functionality: Intercepts and modifies HTTP requests to test authorization checks.
        Usage: Attackers can capture API requests, modify parameters (such as object IDs), and resend the requests to see if they can access or modify unauthorized data.
