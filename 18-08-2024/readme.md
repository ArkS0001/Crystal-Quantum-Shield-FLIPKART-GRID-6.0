Based on the architecture you've sketched out, I can help you create a data flow diagram (DFD) for your project. Here's how the flow can be visualized:

Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Overview
1. External Entities:

User (Flipkart)
Initiates login, product browsing, inventory checking, and payment processes through API calls.
Sends requests for product information, inventory, and payment.
2. Processes:

Login/Authentication:
User credentials are sent for authentication.
Manages user authentication, passing requests to the authentication (Auth) service.
Product & Inventory Management:
Handles product browsing and inventory checking, interfacing with the inventory service.
Payment Processing:
Processes payment requests initiated by the user.
Authorization (RBAC - Role-Based Access Control):
Determines user permissions and routes requests accordingly.
Data Scrambling:
Scrambles or encrypts sensitive data before processing or storage.
Timeout Management:
Ensures that requests are handled within a specific timeframe, terminating slow or unresponsive requests.
Proxy Filtering (NGINX):
Routes incoming requests through filters, applying default values for missing fields and managing headers.
Visualization:
Displays user-friendly data on number of users, roles, permissions, violations, token logs, and more.
3. Data Stores:

Inventory:
Stores product and inventory information.
Token Log:
Logs token usage for security auditing.
Violation Log:
Logs security violations for monitoring and analysis.
4. Data Flows:

User Requests:
Data flows from the user (Flipkart) to various services like authentication, product browsing, and payment.
Authentication Requests:
Credentials flow to the authentication service for validation.
Product & Inventory Data:
Flows from the inventory database to the user via the product and inventory management processes.
Authorization Decisions:
Data flows between the RBAC service and other processes to enforce user permissions.
Scrambled Data:
Sensitive data flows through the scrambling process before being passed on or stored.
Request Handling (Timeout, Proxy Filter):
Data flows through the timeout and proxy filtering processes to ensure timely and secure handling.
Visualization Data:
Data from logs and inventory flows to the visualization process for user-friendly display.
I'll create a DFD based on this description.
